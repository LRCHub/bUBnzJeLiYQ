雪の降る坂道に
キミとふたり
つないだその手は
冷たく凍えて
Don't you cry
Don't you cry
Don't you cry
Don't you cry
Don't you cry
Don't you cry
Don't you cry
Don't you cry
いつか
離さなければならない
この手を
今は
このまま
温めていたいのさ
Don't you cry
Don't you cry
Don't you cry
Don't you cry
Don't you cry
Don't you cry
Don't you cry
Don't you cry
Don't you cry
Don't you cry
Don't you cry
Don't you cry
