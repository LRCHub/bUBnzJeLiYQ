Gonna leave you here
Gonna leave you at the station
Got a long way to go, baby
Woman, don't you cry for me

Got no time to play
Gonna leave you at the station
Got a long way to go, baby
Woman, don't you cry for me

Got no time to play
But I don't need no complication
Got a long way to go, baby
Woman, don't you cry for me

There's no one place I wanna be
Attachment only hurts when locked in tight
Better look after yourself before it comes along
So one thing I wanna see
That's the Lord, got to try to keep him in sight
Better look after yourself, baby
Come on, won't you let me be

No time to play
I don't need no complication
Got a long way to go, baby
Woman, don't you cry for me

Gonna lеave you here
I don't need no complication
Got a long way to go, baby
Woman, don't you cry for mе

Got to leave you here
I don't need no complication
Got a long way to go, baby
Woman, don't you cry for me

There's no one place I wanna be
Attachment only hurts when locked in tight
Better take care of yourself, baby
Come on, won't you let me be
There's just one thing I wanna see
That's the Lord, got to try to keep him in sight
Better care after yourself, baby
Come on, won't you let me be

Got no time to play
I don't need no complication
Got a long way to go, baby
Woman, don't you cry for me

Got no time to play
Gonna leave you at the station
Long way to go, baby
Woman, don't you cry for me

A long way to go, baby
Woman, don't you cry for me
Got a long way to go, baby
Woman, don't you cry for me
