It's too late to turn around
You think you're safe but you won't hear a sound
Until you're run aground
Nothing left for you to fear
The words of warning that you couldn't hear
As th siren draws you near All we share will still remain
Don't cry(Don't say goodbye)A promise always stays the same
So don't say goodbye(Don't say goodbye)Don't you cry, Don't you cry, Cry. Evey breath could be the last
A soul survivor calling from the past
Their hopes are fading fast
Nothing left, but empty space
A field of memories you can't erase
Anothertime and place All we share will still remain
Don't cry(Don't say goodbye)A promise always stays the same
So don't say goodbye(Don't say goodbye)Don't you cry, Don't you cry, Cry.
Don't you cry, Don't you cry, Cry.
