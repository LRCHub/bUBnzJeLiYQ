Don't cry, baby
Don't cry my little baby
Dry your eyes
Let's be sweethearts again

Mhh, you know I didn't mean
To ever treat you so mean
Come on sweetheart
Let's try it over again

Don't cry, baby
Don't cry, little baby
Dry your eyes
Let's be sweethearts again

Ah, I know you know I didn't mean
To ever treat you so mean
Why don't you come on sweetheart?
Let's try it over again
