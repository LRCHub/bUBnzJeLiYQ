Why don't you?
Why, why, why don't you cry-y-y?
Why don't you?
Stuck in the mirror never seeing clearer
So open your eyes now it's getting cloudy
I see your words, they're tryna get out
Tryna get out
Why, why, why, why, why, why
Why, why, why, why, why, why
Why don't you cry? Why don't you cry?
Why, why, why, why, why, why
Why, why, why, why, why, why
Why don't you cry? Why don't you cry?
So stuck in the mirror start getting clearer
When I close my eyes, I
I can see the sky at night
Past the blue and the ozone layer
Past the polluted atmosphere
Nothing is more important than our connection
Me and the mother singing the universal song
Calling each other
Why don't we all just sing along?
Why, why, why, why, why, why
Why, why, why, why, why, why
Why don't you cry? Why don't you cry?
Why, why, why, why, why, why
Why, why, why, why, why, why
Why don't you cry? Why don't you cry?
Why don't you?
Why, why, why don't you cry?
Why, why, why don't you?
Why, why, why, why? Why don't you cry!
Why, why, why, why, why, why
Why, why, why, why, why, why
Why don't you cry? Why don't you cry?
Why, why, why, why, why, why
Why, why, why, why, why, why
Why don't you cry? Why don't you cry?
