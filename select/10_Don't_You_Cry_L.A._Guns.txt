Hey babe, gonna be all right
Dance naked in the moonlight
Rock and roll has survived

Come on and spin the wheel
Tell me how you like the deal
Was it good for you as it was for me?

Life is what goes on in between your plans
Does anyone else hear that noise?
You tried to warn me, but I could not understand
I never really had a choice

Come on now, baby
Come on now, baby
Come on now, baby
Don't you cry?

Let's go and drive all night
The highway feels just alright
Can you hear the call of the one's
That came before you?

I hope it's understood
When anything that feels that good
Emotion turns to motion
And that's the truth

It's no use running from a thing that you can't see
When you got no place left to hide
Be the person that she wanted you to be
Keeping it real inside

Come on now, baby
Come on now, baby
Come on now, baby
Don't you cry?

Come on now, baby
Come on now, baby
Come on now, baby
Don't you cry?

Come on now, baby
Come on now, baby
Come on now, baby
Don't you cry?

Come on now, baby
Come on now, baby
Come on now, baby
Dry your eyes

Come on now, baby
Come on now, baby
Come on now, baby
Don't you cry?

Come on now, baby
Come on now, baby
Come on now, baby
Don't you cry?
