If you're tired of holding on
And you feel you can't go on
When it's all too much to bear
Call my name

If the sun refused to shine
And you're all used up from trying
When you can't hold back the tears
I'll be there
I'll be there

So don't you cry
Don't you cry
Wipe the tears from your eyes
Forget about goodbyes
Baby don't you cry

If you feel your love grow cold
When it chills your heart and soul
If you need a hand to hold
Think of me

You're the reason I love
You're my heaven above
You're the reason I try
So dry the tears in your eyes
You're the reason I'm here
The reason I'm living for

So if you're tired of holding on
And you feel you can't go on
When it's all too much to bear
I'll be there
